## How to download
### Linux/Mac Command Line
Install `git` onto your system, you can Google how to do this
~~~
cd ~/path/to/the/place/you/want/it #eg. cd ~/Desktop

### Windows

[One tutorial I found](http://guides.beanstalkapp.com/version-control/git-on-windows.html)

I apologize as I don't use any Windows machines for git. Thus I am not super experienced with it. The above linked tutorial should help as well as Googling. As a last resort, downloading the zip could do or just browsing through github.

## How to update
~~~
cd ~/wherever/you/put/it/F17-280
git pull
